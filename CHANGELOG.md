#### Added
- Suppport customized notification center (CallNotificationCenter/PhoneNotificationCenter) based on protocol (CallObserver/PhoneObserver), to avoid NSNotificationCenter flaws:
    - Pass parameters via a userInfo dicionary, so type info is lost.
    - Use constant string for notification name and parameter key name. It's hard to maintain and document.
    - Must deregister notifications, if not, it may cause crash.

- Support toggling receiving audio and video. New API Call.toggleReceivingVideo()/Call.toggleReceivingAudio() is introduced for it.
